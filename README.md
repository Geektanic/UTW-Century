# CIT 330 - UnderTheWire Centruy Solutions

It's not the prettiest write up, and it may not help you fully wrap your head around what all goes into each level of UTW Century, but this document will hopefully give you some idea of how to solve the various UTW Century levels. All items are thoughts and processes I logged while going through UTW Century in prep for assigning it to you in CIT 330. I had completed UTW Century a few years ago, so this was basically a quick blind run, as my notes will make apparent.

Not all levels have full explanations, primarily the first few ones - some only include the solutions. If I had to stop and think, I tried my best to jot down what I was thinking and what I would end up finding after some quick research.

I also must remind everyone that I have never claimed to be a PowerShell wizard, and so in a few spots I admit confusion. Never be afraid to admit confusion, but do try and use it as an opporutnity to learn a thing.
