  Get-ChildItem returns many directories. "Can You Open Me" appears to have spaces.
  Get-ChildItem and hitting tab auto-completes the directory to:
    Get-ChildItem '.\Can You Open Me'

  $env:computername gets the local hostname
  After Googling I settle on using:
  [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostByName(($env::computername))
  that returned: utw.underthewire.tech
  Also works: Get-Item - Path env:* (can't -Filter "*domain*" on this)
  Can limit with something like: Get-Item -Path env:* | Where-Object{$_.Name -like "*domain*"}

  We need to be in profile, not desktop: cd ..
    Powershell: Set-Location ..
  help Get-ChildItem to peruse the options - there is a -Filter and a -Recurse
  Get-ChildItem -Filter "readme*" -Recurse
  There is a readme.txt in Downloads
  cd Downloads
  cat readme.txt
    Powershell: Get-Content readme.txt

  I imagine it's going to be something similar to (uses different args):
  cat unique.txt | measure-object
  Using the help system I have found Sort-Object has a -Unique arg
  cat unique.txt | Sort-Object -Unique | Measure-Object

  We can have cat (Get-Content) use the spaces between words as a delimiter to make a list
  cat Word-File.txt -Delimiter " "
  We can use Select-Object using the -Index arg to grab the 160th object (160 index = 161 object; starts counting at 0)
  cat Word-File.txt -Delimiter " " | Select-Object -Index 160

  Get-Service lists all the services, and can specify a service for it specifically (so, in this case Get-Service "Windows Update"), but I'm not sure how to pull full info such as Description
  help Get-Service -examples doesn't have anything that looks useful in this situation
  After some Googling I found some Get-CimInstance stuff that I was able to adapt to:
  Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like "Windows Update"} | Select Description
    ALSO: Get-WMIObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter  "Name='wuauserv'"  | Select-Object *
  It's not perfect, especially since this requires manually counting words, but it does the job.

  Searching through the profile again
  cd ..
  Get-Child item can once again search recursively again, but this time we'll have it check out attributes for Hidden files
  Get-ChildItem -Attributes "Hidden" -File -Recurse
  I see the answer with a quick scroll, but oh no, plenty of areas we can't access or don't want. Going to adapt to exclude AppData directory:
  Get-ChildItem -Exclude AppData | Get-ChildItem -Attributes "Hidden" -File -Recurse
  Muuuuch cleaner.

  This feels pretty similar to an earlier objectives...did I do that one earlier differently than they expected or...
  cat countmywords -Delimiter " " | Measure-Object

<p>Century 14->Century 15</p>

  I tried all kinds of combinations similar to:
  Get-Content countpolos | Select-String -Pattern "polo" -AllMatches | Measure-Object
  I just can't get these types of things to return anything other than "1" - most likely due to it all being one large chunk of text (so one object that does indeed include a match of "polo" somewhere, despite -AllMatches)
  Tried out some delimiter stuff, expecting it to probably not be correct - I'm not sure how Select-String interprets line breaks
  Get-Content .\countpolos -Delimiter " " | Select-String -Pattern "polo" -AllMatches | Measure-Object
  This returns 158 which I thought seemed like a good answer, but does not authenticate Century15
  
  I started down the path of wrapping my cmdlets and using the match and counts, despite being pretty sure it's very similar or exactly the same as the above attempts
  (cat .\countpolos | Select-String -Pattern "polo" -AllMatches).Matches.Count
  Returns 158 - still a no go
  
  Eventually, while Googling, I stumbled upon what looked like a solution, which makes me feel bad, but it works
  ((Get-Content .\countpolos).split() | ?{$_ -eq "polo"}).Count
  Return 153 - the password
  
  I'm not 100% sure I'm wrapping my head around what the difference is when using a split vs. the -Delimiter on a space (PowerShell split by default is whitespace), but it's obviously doing something different
